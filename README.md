## Key features

* Encrypt, decrypt values stored in database fields
* Using standard Laravel's Crypt service
* Easy configuration

## Requirements

* Laravel: 11.0 and up
* PHP: 8.2 and newer

#### Database schema

Encrypted values are stored as plain text so in most cases takes up more spaces then unencrypted one.
Recommendation is to alter table column to `TEXT` type.
If you want use `VARCHAR` or `CHAR` column type still you need to check if encrypted value fit.

#### Note:
Do not worry if you have current data in your database not encrypted and added column to `$encryptable`  - they will return as is.    
On save values will be encrypted and everything will work fine.

## Installation

Via Composer command line:

```bash
$ composer require betterapp/laravel-db-encrypter
```

## Usage

1. Use the `betterapp\LaravelDbEncrypter\Traits\EncryptableDbAttribute` trait in any Eloquent model that you wish to use encryption
2. Define a `protected $encryptable` array containing a list of the encrypted attributes.

For example:

```php
    
    use betterapp\LaravelDbEncrypter\Traits\EncryptableDbAttribute;

    class Client extends Eloquent {
        use EncryptableDbAttribute;
       
        /** @var array The attributes that should be encrypted/decrypted */
        protected $encryptable = [
            'id_number', 
            'email',
        ];
    }
```

3. You can use Laravel's original $casts to cast decrypted values
